# Kono API

API server written with Hono (name is a coincidence).

```sh
bun install
bun dev
```

```sh
bun deploy
```

[For generating/synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types):

```sh
bun run cf-typegen
```

Pass the `CloudflareBindings` as generics when instantiation `Hono`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>()
```
